# ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOUR SORTING PATH IS BEFORE ANY OF THE CONFIG INFORMATION
#
#
# TO ADD PATHS, SIMPLY add a comma
# and paste your desired path.
# ADD AS MANY AS YOU'D LIKE
# BECAUSE THIS APPLICATION MAKES USE OF MULTITHREADING.
#
SORTING_PATH=DRIVE:\DIRECTORY,DRIVE:\OTHER_DIRECTORY,DRIVE2:\ANOTHER_DIRECTORY\etc
#
#
#
#
# MAKE SURE YOUR REGEX PATTERNS ARE ON SEPARATE LINES
# KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SORTING HAPPENS FROM MOST SPECIFIC TO LEAST SPECIFIC
# FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A WORD DOCUMENT THAT MATCHES A PATTERN
# IT WILL ALWAYS SORT ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN FIRST. THIS IS BY DESIGN.
# IT GOES PATTERN -> CUSTOM WORDS -> FILE EXTENSIONS (THIS IS HARDCODED)
